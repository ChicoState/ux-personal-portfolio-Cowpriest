My name is Erik Burgess and I am a Computer Science major.  I have programmed (in C++) a student records program that would take in new students and some info about them and create a searchable database that was capable of saving to file and loading a database from a file.  I have also programmed (in Assembly) a four function calculator that did not use any add, subtract, multiply, nor divide commands as well as a snake game that was purely extra credit.

I have ambitions of programming learning algorithms for animated robots that include path finding and dicision making.
